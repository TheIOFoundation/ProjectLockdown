# About this module

The Funnels are the different methods that Project Lockdown employs to
- Identify Source Origins and triage the obtained Sources
- Encode the Sources into DSL data points
- Review the data points for quality assurance

Project Lockdown uses the following Funnels:
- Insourcing: The data is generated by Project Lockdown's Team Research. <br/>
[Repo Folder](https://github.com/TheIOFoundation/ProjectLockdown/tree/master/Funnels/IS) | [Wiki](https://github.com/TheIOFoundation/ProjectLockdown/wiki/Insourcing)

- Crowdsurcing: The data is generated by citizens outside of Project Lockdown.  <br/>
[Repo Folder](https://github.com/TheIOFoundation/ProjectLockdown/tree/master/Funnels/CS) | [Wiki](https://github.com/TheIOFoundation/ProjectLockdown/wiki/Crowdsourcing)

- Machine Learning (NLP): The data is generated through Natural Language Processing algorithms.  <br/>
[Repo Folder](https://github.com/TheIOFoundation/ProjectLockdown/tree/master/Funnels/ML) | [Wiki](https://github.com/TheIOFoundation/ProjectLockdown/wiki/Machine-Learning-(NLP))

- Direct Feed: Public Authorities and equivalent bodies that generate policies can upload the ppolicy data directly to the database.  <br/>
