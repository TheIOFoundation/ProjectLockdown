# About this module

The Mapping Platform (MAP) module offers an accessible representation of the data in Project Lockdown.
It provides:
- An interactive map where DataSet Layers (DSL) are presented
- A StatsBox (SB) with contextual information valuable to the DSL
- A Time Slider (TS) to navigate through the DSL across time
- A Territory Detail Overlay (TDO) that showcases all the DSL data points organized by categories + a report view of them
- A Search box (S) to locate specific territories
- A Tab Menu (TB) that contains all the specific information of the DSL, from methodology to information on each data point
- A simple QueryString controlled interface that allows to customize the final user experience and embed the MAP in any other website
